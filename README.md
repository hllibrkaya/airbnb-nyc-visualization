To extract meaningful insights from the dataset, outlier data has been filtered in some of the visualizations. Due to some issues with drawing certain plots using PyQt5, some of them have not been included. You can examine all the graphics in the 'visualization.ipynb' file, and the Pyqt5 version is available in the 'visualize.py' file.
In the PyQt5 version, the plots are selected from a combo box and displayed using the 'show plot' button. Additionally, the navigation bar used in Matplotlib has been directly added. This allows features such as zoom in/out, printing to be applied to the charts.
